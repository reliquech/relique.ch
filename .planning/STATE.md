## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Foundation-first execution: merge → data layer → security → consolidation → admin UX
- Payments removed from v1 (2026-06-14) — browse-only marketplace; Stripe defer v2
- Single app survivor: `apps/web` with `/admin` route group
- Admin-only UX redesign v1; public site functional fixes only

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

From `.planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md`:

- Phase 4 migration incomplete — verify/consign still localStorage until Phase 2
- ~50 `@ts-expect-error` on Supabase mutations — addressed Phase 5 (DATA-06)
- Unauthenticated register endpoint — addressed Phase 3 (SEC-01)
- Big-bang merge risk — Phase 1 must be incremental (layout → auth → API → UI)
